<div class="page">

  As a patron you can support me and even get involved with the creative process as I explore new dimensions of my work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here you are allowed to give a monthly contribution which helps me keep churning out work consistently and gives you access to exclusive work that I'm busy with as well as other exclusive content.
  <br>
  <br>
  Funds I raise here goes into making ever better artwork, recordings, video’s, live shows, art and merchandise too so it’s a win win for everyone!! When I raise enough i'll even start documenting in real-time which is going to be a really fun art project to undertake!
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrons get exclusive access to limited editions, one time recordings and also have direct interaction with me regarding my creations. If you have idea’s you’d like to see you can tell me about them!
  <br>
  <br>
  This is only for people who want to make a consistent contribution and can afford something regular to help me make magic. You can unsubscribe anytime.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you're not ready now, the invitation is always open if you want to join in. Thanks so much for all the support you’ve shown me so far, I really appreciate it deeply.
